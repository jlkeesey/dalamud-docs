# UI

There are two different systems for managing a plugin's UI: [ImGui](imgui) and
[Atk](atk). ImGui is used to create the main and configuration windows for the
plugin. This is what most people consider the interface. Atk is the system used
to modify the game's actual interface e.g. highlighting action icons.
